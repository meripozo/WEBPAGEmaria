# WEBPAGEmaria 
Description of your work:
This is a website created by María Fernández del Pozo, for Practical Work 2 of the fundamentals subject. It includes various pages: Home, Contact me, Net, About me, Degree and Fundamentals. The topic I have chosen is medical robotics, and the page provides information on three topics: 3D printing, Prosthetic technology and robotic surgery.

Problems during the development:
When I started with the website I had no problems, it was just a little slow when creating the code, but later I picked up the pace.
The first major problem I had was the following: I changed the name of the repository in Github (because it was misspelled), and then the Visual Studio Code got out of sync with the cloud repository, and I couldn't find it. That's why I had to ask Professor Moisés for help. The rest of the minor problems I have had are the following: I had problems writing the paths, changing the icon image, and adding an image to the page that was in a strange format.
Conclusions:
In conclusion, I have learned a lot doing this job, and now I can make a website from scratch. It is very useful for my future, for my professional life. I hope to continue being able to learn as much in the degree I am studying.
