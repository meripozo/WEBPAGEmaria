                Engineering is fundamentally concerned with the endeavor to translate theoretical knowledge into pragmatic and tangible outcomes. Problem Solving
                <br>The primary objective of the "Fundamentals of Computer Engineering" course is to provide a
                comprehensive understanding of Computer Engineering from a global perspective,
                encompassing both academic and professional dimensions. This course is designed to equip
                students with foundational knowledge rooted in disciplines such as mathematics, physics,
                anthropology, and ethics.
                Additionally, it aims to elucidate prospective career trajectories in the field and elucidate the
                pivotal role played by computer engineers in contemporary society.
